# DIABETES-PREDICTION-BUT-USING-PYSPARK-INSTEAD-OF-PANDAS
Most of the people out there, uses pandas, numpy and many other libraries in the data science domain to make predictions for any given dataset. I recently discovered the library pySpark and it's amazing features. I was amazed by this and thought, why not use this as a project to get my hands on experience. I hope you will love it.
